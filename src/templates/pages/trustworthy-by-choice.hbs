    <h1>Trustworthy by choice:</h1>
    <h2>The behavioral promise of Dot-Public.</h2>

    <p><strong>The whole idea behind</strong> what makes Dot-Public’s approach to public service online different
        rests on a single premise. Restoring public trust is not something we will build with a slogan
        or flag with a distinctive design. It will come from behaving with purpose, consistency, and
        restraint.</p>

    <p>The organisations that publish to the Dot-Public domain are not trying to extract value from
        their visitors. They are not monetising attention, tracking behaviour, or nudging for clicks to
        increase dwell time. They are not pretending to serve while quietly harvesting personal data.
        They are who they say they are, doing what they say they are here to do. Nothing more,
        nothing less.</p>

    <p>Dot-Public is a permissioned civic environment. That means its rules are not guidelines, they
        are requirements. But the choice to participate is entirely voluntary. There is no coercion, no
        lock-in, no commercial incentive that is masked by the perceived purpose. If an organisation
        wants the freedom to track users, to target them, to experiment with persuasive techniques,
        it already has plenty of options. It can publish to .com, or .org, or any number of other
        domains where underlying motivations are ambiguous and the burden of understanding falls
        on the user.</p>

    <p>But if it chooses to publish to Dot-Public, it makes a public declaration. It says: “we are here
        to serve you and that’s all. We have no hidden agenda. We are not watching you or selling
        you or nudging you. We respect your rights. We honour your time. And for us public trust is a
        greater reward than the opportunity for commercial gain”
        .</p>

    <h3>What makes Dot-Public different?</h3>

    <p>This is not about moral elitism. It is about clarity of intention. The rules of Dot-Public are
        written down. They are transparent, consistent, and public. Every organisation on the
        domain signs up to them, not because they have to, but because they want to. They want to
        be recognised as trustworthy. They want to be part of a digital public space where civic
        purpose is genuine and verifiable. And because of that the public can rely on them. Not
        because the internet has suddenly become safe, but because this small part of it has
        different standards. And because those standards are adhered to by choice.</p>

    <p>We realise there will always be bad actors out there on the internet. That is a reality we
        cannot deny. Furthermore there is incentive for them to come to Dot-Public and to pretend to
        adopt the Dot-Public rules. There is nothing to gain from infiltrating a space that only works if
        you play by the rules, because it will be a waste of effort. However, Dot-Public is not a
        gateway to mass visibility. It is not a growth ‘hack’ or a short-cut to attention. It is a civic
        commitment to transparency, and that commitment is visible to everyone who visits.</p>

    <p>The enforcement mechanisms are detailed and specific. They cover ownership and mission,
        accessibility, provenance, editorial integrity, data handling, operational transparency, and
        contribution back to the public knowledge ecosystem. There are disqualification triggers and
        oversight functions for each. These are not vague aspirations. They are operational
        requirements. They are designed to ensure that anyone publishing under Dot-Public has
        earned the right to be there and is willing to be held accountable.</p>

    <p>If an organisation cannot or will not meet the standards, it simply does not belong here. And
        it knows that. Which is why it will not try. Because there is nothing to extract. No advantage
        to be gained. No reward for gaming the system. This is not the commercial internet dressed
        in civic clothing. It is a different kind of infrastructure, for a different kind of purpose.</p>

    <h3>What does Dot Public look like?</h3>

    <p>Dot-Public is not a product or a platform. It is a set of guarantees. The visual experience
        should reflect that. It should convey clarity, integrity and seriousness without noise,
        unwanted gloss or affectation. The design should feel deliberate and calm, confident enough
        to be quiet.</p>

    <p>Some services may include advertising or offer subscriptions. Users may be asked to sign
        up or sign in. But none of this is hidden or manipulative. Advertising is not based on unseen
        tracking or behavioural profiling. If services or messages are personalised, the user remains
        in full control of what is known, retained and shared. Consent is meaningful and can be
        withdrawn. The priority is always the user, not the provider.</p>

    <p>Trust is not asserted through branding but earned through consistency. There may be visible
        signals that mark the space as part of Dot-Public, such as a badge or institutional seal, but
        these are secondary. The main reassurance comes from how the service behaves. No
        distractions, no coercion, no Trojan Horses.</p>

    <p>Each institution maintains its own identity and design rules. There is no imposed visual style.
        Coherence comes from shared values. Interfaces are designed for Accessibility, clarity and
        ease of use. Information is not hidden behind misleading labels, screeds of terms and
        conditions, or deceptive structures. Language is respectful, to the point and direct.
        Navigation is simple and unobtrusive. There are never dark patterns.</p>

    <p>Dot-Public services do not try to hold attention or push outcomes. They are never ‘sticky’.
        They aim to be clear, useful and respectful. They feel different because they behave
        differently. They are built to be understood, not optimised for behavioural metrics. The result
        is not a uniform appearance, but a common atmosphere of trust.</p>
