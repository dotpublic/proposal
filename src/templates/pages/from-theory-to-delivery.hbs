    <h1>From theory to delivery:</h1>
    <h2>A three-stage rollout plan</h2>

    <p>Dot-Public will be delivered through a phased build that reflects both the realities of
        institutional readiness and the ambition of long-term civic infrastructure. The three-stage
        process ensures that development begins with high-veracity, public-value material within a
        trusted institutional framework, and expands iteratively across national systems and then
        beyond.</p>

    <h3>Stage One: Irish University Prototype / MVP</h3>

    <p>Led by Trinity College Dublin and supported by the Irish Universities Association (IUA), this
        first stage will create a fully functioning prototype of Dot-Public. It will be built around trusted
        academic and cultural material from Ireland’s seven core universities, including digitised
        monographs, doctoral theses, archival collections, peer-reviewed journals, and curated
        exhibitions. Because Dot-Public is built on three structural pillars, the prototype must show
        that each one can work in practice and together form a coherent civic layer. The prototype
        focus on three essentials:</p>

    <h4>Civic framing</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>The Civic Boundary: services built and accessed within a dedicated namespace.</li>
        <li>The Civic Contract: rules of governance trialled with real institutions and users.</li>
        <li>The Civic Experience: user journeys designed to reflect civic values and public service principles.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>To test these in practice, the MVP will run a set of “testbeds” each designed to explore and prove one critical
        aspect of the model.</p>

    <h4>Testbeds</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>Domain testbed: Provisional namespace (e.g. public.tcd.ie) simulating .PUBLIC, used to explore registry
            functions, DNSSEC, privacy by default, and provenance.</li>
        <li>Governance testbed: Set up a pilot governance body at Trinity drafting and adopting the first Civic
            Contract, testing eligibility, obligations, oversight, and enforcement.</li>
        <li>Reference models testbed: Prototypes of civic search, provenance signals, audit tools, and a trusted archive
            service from Trinity Library.</li>
        <li>Civic experience testbed: Design language, interface markers, and trust-signal testing with students and
            public users.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Although this stage of the delivery programme will be based entirely inside the Ireland
        academic sector, there will also be some limited and controlled, public access and
        evaluation. This will inform the institutional and operational foundation for national
        expansion. By grounding the first phase/s in Ireland’s academic and cultural sectors, the
        MVP provides a controlled yet representative environment in which to test civic-grade
        standards. It ensures that integrity, provenance, and public value are designed into the
        system from the outset.</p>

    <p>The project will not only demonstrate technical feasibility but also establish the operational
        and governance practices required for long-term sustainability. Trinity’s leadership role
        ensures credibility, scholarly rigour, and global visibility, anchoring Dot-Public in an institution
        whose reputation stands for both excellence and trust.</p>

    <h3>Stage Two: National roll-out for Ireland</h3>

    <p>Building on the university prototype, this phase expands Dot-Public into a full national
        service for Ireland, incorporating public-facing integrations with selected government
        departments and cultural institutions. Features will include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Access to verified public records, documentation, and state services (e.g. HSE, Dept of Transport, Dept of
            Education)</li>
        <li>Free, provenance-based access to cultural institutions (e.g. National Library of Ireland, RTÉ, Irish Film
            Institute)</li>
        <li>Secure environments for civic messaging, environmental alerts, and local services</li>
        <li>Multilingual and adaptive service interfaces, supporting diverse user needs</li>
        <li>Initial governance structures rooted in Irish legal and regulatory frameworks</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The national MVP will offer a working demonstration of Dot-Public’s value across education,
        culture, and public administration. It will also test early-stage revenue and participation
        models, including NGO and research sector use.</p>

    <h3>Stage Three: Federated EU Launch – A first ‘Global’ step</h3>

    <p>Following national validation and technical hardening, Dot-Public will federate outward into
        the EU public sphere. The European launch will establish a multi-jurisdictional framework for
        adoption, governance, and long-term sustainability. Key elements include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Coordination with EU digital policy frameworks, including the Digital Services Act,
            Interoperable Europe Act, and Trusted Data Spaces initiatives</li>
        <li>Formation of a European Steering Council and Ethics &amp; Standards Board</li>
        <li>Technical alignment with pan-European infrastructure and open protocol standards</li>
        <li>Federated adoption by cultural institutions, public broadcasters, ministries, and universities across member
            states</li>
        <li>Multilateral agreements on naming conventions, service guarantees, and civic access rules</li>
        <li>Pilots of EU-wide civic applications – e.g. pan-European alerts, supranational public consultations,
            cross-border student and research access</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The European build will not be a rebrand of the Irish phase, but a scaling of its founding
        principles into an adaptable and cooperative civic layer that works across linguistic, legal,
        and institutional diversity.</p>
