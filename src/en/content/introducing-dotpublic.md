# Introducing Dot-Public

## A digital public space on the internet

**The internet has become** the place where people from across the globe now meet, argue, learn, and decide. But it was not built for civic life. Its dominant services reward attention capture, not accuracy; personal data is traded as commodity, without prior consent; and public institutions attempt to compete in spaces they neither control nor trust.

Dot-Public is a proposal to create a new administered zone within the existing internet: a civic space governed by rules of trust, legitimacy, and public purpose. It would not attempt to replace the internet, but simply provide a protected zone where people can find important information and services that meet a higher standard of truth, safety, and accountability.

### Why now:

Public trust is fracturing. People doubt what they see online, and institutions struggle to prove their integrity in environments designed for monetisation rather than impartial service. Incremental reform of existing platforms alone cannot resolve these structural flaws.

Like clean water systems in the 19th century or public broadcasting in the 20th, Dot-Public aims to be the missing civic infrastructure of the digital age. It provides a clear boundary: when they are inside the .PUBLIC domain, citizens know they are operating under transparent and enforceable civic rules; even though outside it, the internet continues as it is.

### How it will work:

Dot-Public is founded on four pillars:

1. **The Civic Boundary (.PUBLIC)** - a permissioned global top-level domain reserved for accredited public institutions, cultural organisations, and mission-aligned publishers and service providers.
2. **The Civic Contract** - rules and standards of behaviour that guarantee privacy, autonomy, and accountability. No data is collected beyond what is strictly necessary, and all personal data always belongs to the user. People can leave any service at any time and take all of their data with them. No hidden code is embedded on a user's device to track behaviour or harvest information. Entry into Dot-Public depends on meeting these standards; continued participation depends on keeping them.
3. **The Civic Experience** - the promise that what people encounter in Dot-Public is authentic, transparent, and inclusive. Organisations will be exactly who they say they are, with institutional identity verified and visible. Sources will be shown where they exist, and uncertainty admitted where they do not. Services must provide equivalent access for everyone, with particular attention to those with disabilities or other disadvantages. Clean tools must be used at all times, free of exploitative code, ad-tech, or manipulative design, so the experience remains uncluttered and safe.
4. **Governance by trust** - a constitutional framework designed to keep Dot-Public independent of state or corporate capture, accountable to a broad civic membership, and forkable if ever compromised.

### First steps:

An MVP is currently being developed, with Trinity College Dublin as a potential anchor institution. This will prototype Dot-Public at national scale, beginning with high-veracity academic and cultural data, then expanding to wider public services. Global brains trust and steering groups are in place, drawing on expertise from libraries, archives, broadcasters, technologists, and civic thinkers.

### Funding and sustainability:

Dot-Public will be funded initially through philanthropic and public-interest support, then sustained by member contributions and tightly defined, transparent revenue models. State sponsorship is to be sought, but only under appropriate terms. Subscriptions, paid services and advertising are permitted but revenue models that profile or track people will never be allowed. Trust is the core asset, and every mechanism for sustainability is designed to protect it.

### Why it matters:

Dot-Public is about more than technology. It is about restoring civic trust in a digital age. A place where public institutions can serve without compromise, where citizens know what they can believe, and where the rules of public life are clear, open, and enforceable.
