# The proposal

## Why the internet needs a public space

**There is no doubt** that the internet has forever changed how people live, learn, and connect. But it was never designed to serve the public's best interests. What began as a decentralised network for free exchange has been captured by a handful of commercial platforms that harvest data, manipulate behaviour, and deepen division.

Public institutions - libraries, archives, universities, museums, and broadcasters - have been forced to operate within hostile systems, under terms and conditions that do not share their values and erode their finances. Citizens are also forced to access public services via online services shaped for profit and control, not trust or care.

This dependence has reached a critical point. Cultural assets are licensed on fragile commercial terms. Public services are compromised by cookies and code that gather invasive and unneeded data. Educational tools are shaped by advertising algorithms. Research collections are locked behind paywalls. Even basic communications are subject to interception, manipulation, disinformation, and predatory commercial intent.

Dot-Public is a structural response. It is not a platform or a product, but civic infrastructure built to last. At its core is the creation of a new global top-level domain, .PUBLIC, as a permanent, enforceable mark of trust. It will provide a trusted space where all participants – including at-risk groups and individuals – can express themselves freely, confidently, and on their own terms. It will ensure dignity, respect and agency, with online interactions grounded in transparency rather than anonymity, free from the distortions of commercial or political capture.

The design is deliberately safeguarded. Dot-Public will be governed by an independent mission-locked body with constitutional protections, transparent oversight, and representation for civic, technical, and marginalised voices. Protocols will be open, its tools reusable, and its standards enforceable.

Dot-Public is not a replacement for the open internet, but an administered zone within it. It provides what has been missing – a civic space online where people can act with confidence, institutions can serve without compromise, and trust can take root again.

### A civic layer built to last

Dot-Public is a proposal to create a new civic layer of the internet. It is not a platform or a product or a channel. It is infrastructure. A foundational environment in which information, services, and civic life can take place without the distortions of commercial capture – so called 'surveillance capitalism' – a parallel environment, designed from the ground up to serve the public interest. It is built on the premise that digital infrastructure, like physical infrastructure, shapes the societies that depend on it. And if we want societies that are inclusive, democratic and fair, then we need digital infrastructure that reflects those values by design.

At the heart of the proposal is a simple idea. If we can agree that the public has certain inalienable rights in digital space, then those rights must be supported by a dedicated, uncompromising structure. Not an afterthought or an add-on, but something permanent. Something institutional. Something built to last.

The core structural element is the creation of a new global, generic Top Level Domain (gTLD), .PUBLIC. This is not a symbolic gesture or a marketing device. It is a practical and enforceable way to establish a distinct and separated civic space online where all participants operate under defined public obligations. Without this anchor at the domain level, it would not be possible to apply the necessary legal and operational frameworks, enforce standards consistently, assure provenance, or protect independence from political or commercial imperatives. The creation of a new top level domain is not intended to relocate the entire burden of change onto the internet's naming system or to bypass the debate on platform governance. Its purpose is to provide an alternative stable, visible, and enforceable environment for trust, within the existing architecture of the internet. Three principles define the structure and purpose of Dot-Public.

### The three foundational pillars of Dot-Public

The first is the Civic Boundary marked by the '.PUBLIC' gTLD. It is the technical and legal framework that makes it possible to enforce standards, guarantee behaviours, and protect independence in ways existing domains cannot. Domains such as .com were created for commercial use and are essentially open to anyone who pays. Others, like .org, are culturally associated with non-profits and civic groups, but in practice have no binding criteria for entry. Any organisation or individual can register, regardless of purpose or conduct.

National domains such as .gov.uk or .org.au can be more tightly controlled, but they are bound to national jurisdictions, vulnerable to domestic political shifts, and inconsistent across borders. None provide a globally recognised signal that a service operates under agreed and enforceable civic obligations. By reserving .PUBLIC exclusively for organisations that meet clear, verifiable, and binding public interest standards with independent oversight, the URL itself becomes a mark of trust. It establishes a visible line between Dot-Public and everything else, and it gives the rules somewhere actionable to live. Without this anchor at the domain level, protections would have to be negotiated piecemeal, jurisdiction by jurisdiction, creating a well-meaning patchwork that, over time, erodes trust and invites capture.

The second pillar is the Civic Contract. As the civic boundary defines where the digital public space begins and ends, the civic contract defines how it is used and by whom. It is a self-administered and binding set of rules that every participant must adhere to, whether they are an institution, a service provider, or an individual. For individuals, the civic contract guarantees privacy by design, ownership of personal data, and the right to withdraw without penalty. For institutions, it requires self-auditing with independent oversight, transparency in decision making, and a commitment to terms that cannot be quietly rewritten. These are enforceable obligations, upheld by an independent governance body, so that no matter who operates within .PUBLIC, the same principles apply to all. They are insulated from the shifting priorities of markets or politics.

The third pillar is the Civic Experience. This recognises that the way a space looks, feels and behaves determines whether people trust it and choose to stay. Within .PUBLIC, the experience is shaped by three principles:

1. The use of clean tools to build the sites and services, that do not gather data, place unasked for tracking devices such as cookies or attempt to retain attention, nudge or manipulate the user,
2. Clarity of intention and inspectable provenance so that every assertion and every piece of information can be traced to its source, and
3. Universal accessibility so no one is shut out because of who they are, where they live, or any disability they may have.

This is not just about interface design. It is the deliberate removal of the underlying coercion, opacity, and exclusion that characterise much of the commercial internet. The civic experience makes trust tangible. It is respectful of boundaries instead of intrusive, transparent instead of concealed, inclusive by default rather than by exception.

Together, these three pillars, the civic boundary, the civic contract, and the civic experience, turn a URL into a promise, and a promise into a protected digital public space that can operate across borders and time.

### Addressing key challenges: Ai, governance, access, and sustainability

With regard to artificial intelligence Dot-Public makes no exaggerated claims, and this is deliberate. Ai, like any other technology, is treated here as a means to an end, not an end in itself. It will never set the purpose of the civic layer or dictate its values. Its role is to serve the public mission, not to define it.

However where it is used, Ai will be applied carefully and transparently to strengthen the civic functions of the infrastructure. This might include improving the clarity and accessibility of information, reducing operational costs, supporting governance and compliance processes, or helping to identify and address risks in ways that respect user rights. Every use will be subject to the same ethical framework that governs Dot-Public as a whole, with openness, accountability, and the protection of both individual and collective interests as non-negotiable principles.

But the existence of a conditioned Top Level Domain, all by itself, is not enough. Dot-Public must also be freely available to everyone, and on their own terms. To that end, we propose a **public carriage obligation**. This means a legal requirement for all internet service providers and mobile network operators to carry Dot-Public traffic at no cost to the user. Like the way emergency calls are always connected. Or the way public service broadcasters are always universally available. The logic is the same. If something is in the public interest, then access to it should not depend on ability to pay or willingness to be tracked.

This obligation is not theoretical. In the United Kingdom, mechanisms of this kind already exist where must-carry provisions are a recognised part of communications law. They allow certain services to be protected by legal status rather than market share. Dot-Public extends that principle to digital infrastructure to ensure that public access is a right, not a privilege. In practice this would be subject to national implementation, in line with local digital and telecommunications frameworks, and would be respectful of existing net neutrality commitments. However the aim is clear – to create a 4As baseline of civic access - Always Available, Always Accessible, just as 112 emergency calls are guaranteed across the EU.

Ensuring that Dot-Public endures and operates in the public interest will depend as much on how it is governed as on how it is built. The rules, protections, and principles that define the space must be backed by a governance model capable of holding them in place over time.

**The governance** of Dot-Public must therefore be as resilient as its technology. It should be independent of governments and markets, structured to serve the public interest alone. Its models should combine transparent oversight, accountable management, and an enduring commitment to the founding principles of independence, trust, openness, inclusion, and universal access. The roles within this structure must be clear, their authority balanced, and their work visible to the public they serve.

Dot-Public will be underpinned by detailed and enforceable codes of conduct, covering five areas:

1. **Infrastructure**: ensuring the network is open, secure, sustainable and interoperable
2. **Publication**: ensuring clarity of authorship, provenance, fact-checking, editorial integrity and cultural relevance
3. **Governance**: ensuring transparency, representation, participation and independence
4. **Finance**: ensuring ethical funding, fair remuneration, and non-extractive value flows
5. **Law**: ensuring user rights, regulatory compliance, and legal recourse mechanisms

All participants, including public institutions, civic organisations, and independent creators, would be expected to operate within a framework of shared principles. Oversight and accountability would be ensured through a decentralised governance mechanism, supported by an independent standards body or network of competent authorities, empowered to review potential violations and recommend proportionate remedies in accordance with national and international legal frameworks

In the first instance Dot-Public will be tested through a prototype developed in partnership with at least one leading academic or cultural institution. This pilot will serve as a live proving ground for the rules, technical architecture, and governance models, while demonstrating how the civic layer can operate within existing internet infrastructure

Dot-Public is conceived as permanent civic infrastructure, and like all such infrastructure it must be designed for **long-term financial stability**. The commitment to build and maintain it begins, at least in part, with recognising its necessity and considering a mechanism for an assured foundation of public support. That base is then reinforced by the participation of the institutions that depend on it, whose contributions reflect the shared responsibility of maintaining the space they inhabit.

Beyond this, there is scope for revenues generated within the rules of the civic framework itself. These may come from organisations using Dot-Public to deliver paid-for services, from ventures that generate income while respecting its uncompromising standards, or from the careful and consensual use of data in ways that directly benefit contributing users. The aim is not to commercialise the space itself, but to ensure that its operation is never wholly dependent on a single source of funding, nor vulnerable to short-term shifts in political or market conditions.

The precise mix of all of these factors will differ between nations and states, reflecting local appetite, policy, and capacity. What matters is that the principle of public service is embedded from the outset: that Dot-Public is a shared asset with shared upkeep, financed through a balanced combination of public commitment, institutional participation, and appropriate, principled revenue streams. Designing and refining that balance will be a core task for the project's convening body, working with partners and policymakers to match financial resilience to the civic mission.

### A moral imperative: Protecting the most vulnerable

Strong governance creates the conditions for trust, but the test of that trust is how well it protects those least able to protect themselves. Nowhere is the need for a civic internet more urgent than in the experience of children, young people, and the most vulnerable. They are the least able to negotiate the complexity, coercion, and hidden incentives of the commercial internet, yet they are often the most exposed to its effects. For them, the online environment is not an optional extra. It is where they go to learn, play, socialise, seek help, and form their understanding of the world.

Today, that environment is largely designed to capture their attention, harvest their data, and influence their behaviour. Children encounter services that reward compulsive use, amplify harmful material, and encourage self-comparison on terms that are impossible to win. Young people are pushed into spaces where identity is shaped and policed by opaque algorithms. Those already vulnerable, whether through social isolation, economic hardship, disability, or other disadvantage, face additional risks: targeted scams, exclusion from essential services, and exposure to hostile behaviour or harmful situations without meaningful recourse.

These conditions are not accidental. They are the result of design choices made without the consent, and often without the knowledge, of those most affected. Regulation alone has proven too slow, too fragmented, and too limited in scope to prevent harm at scale.

This is not a call for a separate, walled-off 'children's internet.' It is the recognition that designing for the most vulnerable creates safer, more trustworthy conditions for everyone. By making Dot-Public safe for those least able to defend themselves, we make it better for all who use it. The urgency is clear: the longer the youngest and most vulnerable grow up in an environment optimised for division and exploitation, the harder it will be to imagine anything else.

To make this protection tangible, Dot-Public could support dedicated entry points for those who might otherwise be excluded, including children, families without reliable internet access, and individuals facing economic or social barriers. Whether through secure devices, connection schemes, or other trusted gateways, these mechanisms would ensure that the people who benefit most from a civic internet are also the first to reach it.

Dot-Public will not be simply imposed upon the public - it will be shaped with and by them. From the beginning, **a dedicated civic engagement platform** will invite meaningful participation across all stages of development, ensuring that the initiative earns its legitimacy through co-production, not just consultation. This platform will provide clear, multilingual explainers, contextual briefings, design consultations, and responsive mechanisms for public input.

We believe that the existence of a civic boundary on the internet changes the terms of engagement for everyone. Within Dot-Public, the civic contract would guarantee privacy, dignity, and control over personal data as default rights. The civic experience would remove manipulative design patterns and replace them with tools that serve the user's own purposes. Provenance standards would make information traceable, and universal accessibility rules would ensure no one is locked out because of who they are or what resources they have.

Dot-Public, as described here, is not a promise of guaranteed outcomes. We do not suggest that Dot-Public would solve every problem of the digital age. Nor do we underestimate the scale of legal, technical, and financial questions it raises. Building and sustaining such a system – a decidedly non-trivial challenge – would demand ongoing resources, constant governance, and continuous public scrutiny. The costs, complexities, and unintended consequences would need careful study and debate.

Yet the alternative, passively accepting the digital realm solely as an extension of private markets, comes with its own unsustainable costs. It risks leaving individuals, communities, institutions, and democratic societies without the civic infrastructure we increasingly need.

### A call to leadership

Thomas Paine once wrote, "We have it in our power to begin the world over again." This is such a moment. What is required now is not permission from those who profit most from the status quo. It requires leadership, from those willing to recognise that the internet has become too important, too embedded into daily life, to be left to commercial forces alone.

This is a call to action for all those with the power to influence. We need leaders in government who will support the creation of a public digital commons. We need technologists and academics who will dedicate their skills to building open, accountable systems. We need philanthropists and investors who will fund mission-driven projects.

And we need businesses and media leaders who will step forward and champion new service models that prioritise public value over profit. Dot-Public is more than a technical proposal; it is an invitation to collaborate, a blueprint for a shared future, and an opportunity to build a digital foundation that honors our legacy and creates a public resource of lasting value that future generations will be proud to inherit.
