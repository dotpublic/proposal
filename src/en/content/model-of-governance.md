# Introducing Dot-Public {.app-content-centered}
## A digital public space on the internet {.app-content-centered}

**Dot-Public is conceived not only as a technical architecture** but as a civic institution. Its viability depends less on code than on trust, and trust must be earned, demonstrated, and protected through governance. The governance framework is therefore not a support act to the technical build; it is the decisive factor that will determine whether Dot-Public can endure, expand, and remain free of capture.

It will be governed through a federated, multi-level framework designed to safeguard its public purpose, ensure operational resilience, and maintain legitimacy across jurisdictions. It will operate as a transnational civic infrastructure while allowing for subsidiarity, national legal compatibility, and institutional diversity.

### Standards
As a minimum, all participating services and institutions will be required to meet baseline public service obligations, in line with international human rights law and United Nations standards, including the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), the UN General Assembly Resolution 78/213, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (notably Goals 4, 9, 10, and 16), and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.

Digital participation will require transparent reporting, alignment with the UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science and the UNESCO Guidelines for the Governance of Digital Platforms, and compliance with recognised civic standards for privacy, accessibility, non-discrimination, and data minimisation.

### Purpose of governance
Governance provides the guardrails within which Dot-Public can operate as a trusted digital public space. It is designed to:

- Define the principles and rules of participation
- Ensure transparency in decision-making
- Prevent capture by any state, corporation, or narrow interest
- Maintain the legitimacy of Dot-Public as a public good that benefits everyone and excludes no one.
- Safeguard Dot-Public as a sovereign civic space with a long-term mandate

### Principles

1. **Independence**: Dot-Public must be structurally insulated from direct political or commercial control.
2. **Transparency**: All major decisions, rule changes, and operational reports must be made public and archived.
3. **Accountability**: Every decision-making body must be answerable to a higher civic forum.
4. **Inclusion**: Governance must reflect geographic, institutional, and social diversity.
5. **Subsidiarity**: Decisions should be taken at the most local level possible while preserving the integrity of the system.
6. **Integrity**: No action should compromise civic trust for convenience, growth, or revenue.
7. **Resilience**: Dot-Public must remain forkable and recoverable if governance fails, ensuring continuity of civic service.

### Proposed structure

Governance is organised at three tiers, each with distinct responsibilities:

1. **The Dot-Public Trust**
   - A legally independent, non-profit foundation [registered in a neutral jurisdiction?].
   - Holds the charter, the '.PUBLIC' gTLD, and the constitutional rules.
   - Responsible for ensuring long-term adherence to civic purpose.[How?]
   - Overseen by a Board of Guardians: individuals of global standing appointed for fixed, non-renewable terms, selected through a transparent process by a broad civic assembly.

2. **The Council of Members**
   - Initially composed of accredited public institutions (libraries, archives, universities, public broadcasters, etc.) who meet the entry criteria.
   - Sets policy directions, approves budgets, and ratifies standards.
   - Elects representatives to working groups and technical committees.

3. **Operational Duty**
   - Professional staff responsible for day-to-day management, technical operations, and compliance monitoring.
   - SOperates under a code of conduct requiring openness and neutrality.
   - Publishes regular operational and financial reports.

### Safeguards against capture
- **Term limits**: All senior governance roles are time-limited and non-renewable. [Ever!]
- **Diversity quotas**: Regional, institutional, and demographic representation is embedded into selection processes. [does this actuall; safeguard?]
- **Forkable infrastructure**: All code and standards remain open, allowing members to create parallel instances if governance fails. [Cory put this in - I think]
- **Conflict of interest rules**: Board and Council members must disclose interests and recuse themselves when appropriate.
- **Transparency obligations**: Minutes, financials, and audits are published by default.

### Decision-making
- **Constitutional matters** (e.g. changes to the charter, governance structure, or civic principles) require [supermajority?] approval from both the Trust and the Council.
- **Operational matters** (e.g. budgets, technical standards) are approved by simple majority in the Council, subject to review by the Trust.
- **Dispute resolution** is handled by an independent 'Ombuds' panel drawn from outside the membership. [Wikipedians?]

### Standards and enforcement
- All members must ALWAYS adhere to civic standards on digital hygiene, data stewardship, accessibility, and provenance, as outlined in the Dot-Public rulebook.
- Compliance is reviewed through periodic audits.
- Sanctions for breaches range from warnings to suspension or expulsion.
- Appeals may be made to the 'Ombuds' panel.

### Funding and sustainability
- Initial funding from philanthropic and public-interest donors, ring-fenced to insulate from commercial influence.
- Long-term sustainability through member contributions scaled to institutional size, plus limited revenue from accreditation services.
- Explicit prohibition on advertising, monetisation of user data (without a subject fiduciary involved), or profit distribution.

### Permitted revenue generation
Revenue generation within Dot-Public must be transparent, mission-aligned, and free from hidden incentives. Participating institutions and publishers may generate income through the following permitted means:

1. **Subscriptions and access fees** - Institutions may charge for direct access to their own material or services, provided the terms are clear and non-discriminatory.
2. **Pay-per-view or pay-per-read** - One-off access charges are allowed where appropriate to cover costs and generate income.
3. **Contextual display advertising** - Ads must be proportionate and secondary to the civic purpose of the service. Any data-driven, targeted advertising must be approved by someone (including automated agents) having a duty of care and loyalty to the person whose attention is being sought. Thus, static, clearly labelled advertising in the style of pre-digital newspaper or broadcast ads is permitted. Advertising that relies on personal data, tracking, or behavioural profiling will need a fiduciary of the citizen in the loop. Contextual display advertising – Static, clearly labelled advertising in the style of pre-digital newspaper or broadcast ads is permitted, provided it does not rely on personal data, tracking, or behavioural profiling. Ads must be proportionate and secondary to the civic purpose of the service.
4. **Institutional contributions** - Members contribute scaled fees to support the shared infrastructure, ensuring sustainability without dependence on commercial influence.

Explicitly prohibited are revenue models that rely on profiling, behavioural targeting, resale of user data, or covert sponsorships that would compromise trust.

### Public accountability
1. An annual Civic Assembly is held in open session, allowing the wider public and civil society groups to scrutinise performance.
2. All documentation is preserved in a publicly accessible archive.[CLOCKSS?]
3. Civic metrics (trust surveys, accessibility reports, audit outcomes) are published annually as the key measure of success.

Dot-Public will not be state-run, nor centralised under a single authority. Its design recognises the complexity of digital governance, and ensures democratic legitimacy by embedding accountability at each level – from citizen feedback platforms to national audits and service-wide performance reviews.

Legitimacy will rest not on political appointment or market dominance, but on its civic mandate and enforceable values. Technical delivery may be managed by a nonprofit entity operating under contract, but ultimate responsibility will reside with the network of accountable public bodies that comprise the [Dot-Public Federation?].

This structure ensures that Dot-Public can grow as a trusted, pluralistic infrastructure, coordinated at scale, but rooted in national legal traditions and democratic oversight.
