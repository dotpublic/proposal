# Who's behind Dot-Public:

## A mission to develop a better internet

**Dot-Public Ltd. has been formed as an independent entity**, to explore and develop ideas on how a civic layer of the internet could become reality, to build working models of the solutions it conceives, and to demonstrate its practical application and real-time use. Our ultimate goal is to create a digital public space where institutions, cultural organisations, and civic actors can be trusted to serve people openly, honestly, and without hidden agendas, and where individuals can, once again, participate freely, and safely, both openly and privately, without being deceived and divided through falsehood and outrage or entrapped and manipulated to be packaged and sold as behavioural data.

### A civic internet for the public good

We propose a new, safer, trustworthy digital environment, a digital public space, that sits alongside the current internet and bridges between the uncompromising old services and reconsidered public-interest ones. It would combine public administration (mandating interoperability, supporting modification, enforcing safe harbours) with public goods (open protocols, reference code, free software, governance standards, rules of conduct, personal security) and public infrastructure (access to open networks, independent data repositories, trusted domains) to guarantee that essential digital services are run freely and on terms that protect citizens, not exploit them.

Our goal is structural, not cosmetic. We aim to build something that endures: a parallel civic layer, governed in the public interest, free from capture, and strong enough to support the services, relationships, common goals, and shared objectives that functioning societies need. This is not about tinkering with today's broken systems. It is about creating a foundation for something better, and leaving it in public hands for generations to come.

### Dot-Public Ltd. exists to:

- Consider how online trust, privacy, and democratic resilience can be rebuilt
- Develop principles and rules for a digital public space that is managed transparently and accountable to the public that it serves
- Test whether these ideas can work beyond theory and at scale
- Consider how online trust, privacy, and democratic resilience can be rebuilt
- Deliver practical demonstrations and technically proficient prototypes that turn strategy and policy into working solutions
- Consider how online trust, privacy, and democratic resilience can be rebuilt
- Build the evidence base to inform future decisions in support of global efforts towards creating a shared, trusted civic internet infrastructure

Ultimately, our goal is to demonstrate that public digital infrastructure is as essential today as roads, water, or hospitals and other universally accessible public goods and services that previous generations built to support social cohesion and underpin civilised progress.

### How we work and what we will build

We aim to **create** new technical, legal, and institutional solutions that demonstrate how public digital infrastructure can function in practice. We look to **curate** and share the knowledge, standards, and lessons from around the world, to inform better design choices and avoid repeating old mistakes. And we will **convene** the people, organisations, institutions, and networks needed to make our work genuinely inclusive, representative, participatory, and durable.

### Dot-Public Ltd. will:

- **Develop design principles:** Create clear civic rules and standards for digital public spaces, balancing openness, privacy, and accountability
- **Test feasibility:** Examine the technical, legal, and economic realities of building a civic layer for the internet
- **Publish its research and ideas:** Share discussions, analysis, concepts, and working models openly through articles, essays, and public briefings
- **Convene public conversations:** Host discussions, workshops, and debates to test ideas, gather feedback, and invite wider participation
- **Prototype ideas:** Run small experiments to demonstrate critical concepts such as provenance, civic identity, service delivery, inclusion, privacy guarantees, and trust signals
- **Develop larger pilot projects:** Including the proposed Trinity College prototype, which would build and host real services, digital collections, and trust mechanisms within a pilot.public.ie domain
- **Develop trust signals:** Design user experiences to include trust indicators, transparency tools, and provenance links so that people can recognise with confidence when they are in a public-first environment
- **Ensure device compatibility:** Ensure any solutions work equally well on mobile devices and low-spec hardware, reflecting the real conditions in libraries, schools, and our communities of greatest need
- **Explore governance models:** Identify sustainable ways to manage shared civic infrastructure across public institutions, diverse organisations, and national borders
- **Create open-access resources:** Develop guides, toolkits, and reference materials to help institutions and communities understand, adopt, and shape the civic layer of the internet
- **Build networks:** Grow a community of thinkers, technologists, institutions, and funders committed to the creation and maintenance of public digital infrastructure
- **Assess the feasibility of must-carry obligations:** To guarantee universal access to public and civic services without technology barriers or commercial interference
- **Contribute to the debates around digital sovereignty:** Explore how Dot-Public might support strategic digital autonomy and reduce dependency on non-national or commercial technology providers

### Think – Test – Build – Share

Dot-Public is ambitious. It proposes structural changes to how a dedicated part of the internet can work and how institutions can choose to engage with citizens online. However, it would be risky and costly to launch large-scale technical solutions before proving that the ideas will work, the rules can be enforced, that institutions will participate, and that users will come to trust and adopt them.

### This approach will allow us to:

- Debate the issues
- Clarify priorities
- Gather the right mix of skills and partners
- Develop working models for funders and policymakers
- Test governance and policy ideas before building large-scale systems
- Construct working prototypes, ensuring that policy thinking about technology and user experience is grounded in practical reality

And ensure that when Dot-Public is built and running, it is designed for enduring civic value and resilience, rather than to demonstrate short-term technological accomplishment.

### Who we invite to join us

We welcome participation from:

- Academics and researchers
- Libraries, archives, and cultural institutions
- Public-interest technologists focused on privacy, encryption, identity, or digital provenance
- Policy experts in internet governance, law, and regulation
- Civil society organisations
- Government agencies interested in civic digital infrastructure
- Funders who believe the internet should also serve the public good

Alongside these, we welcome support and contributions from anyone committed to the principle that digital public service infrastructure must be just as reliable, stable, trustworthy, and equitable as the physical infrastructure our societies have built in previous generations.

### Outcomes

The outcomes we aim to deliver / The work will generate:

- Policy and technical white papers
- Pilot projects on existing domains such as .org or .ie to test civic standards
- Governance recommendations for a future .PUBLIC domain
- Standards for transparency, privacy, and provenance
- Engagement with governments, regulators, and public institutions
- A working pilot developed with Trinity College, demonstrating real services, trust signals, and governance in action

Plus other policy frameworks and agreements to determine how a civic internet layer could operate alongside existing commercial systems without undermining their viability, but instead providing an alternative so that the public in all participating nations can recognise, appreciate, and choose to use it whenever they wish or need to.

Dot-Public's long-term vision remains the creation of a dedicated civic layer for the internet. But our first step is to think rigorously, build confidently, and work collaboratively to make it real, credible, and sustainable.

Dot-Public is not another digital portal or platform. It is an attempt to change the ground beneath them – to lay down the shared and dependable civic infrastructure that the internet never got, where public institutions and communities can operate on rules of trust, dignity, and accountability.

Our goal is structural, not cosmetic. We aim to build something that endures: a parallel civic layer, governed in the public interest, free from capture, and strong enough to support the services, relationships, and shared truths that a functioning society needs. This is not about tinkering with today's broken systems. It is about creating a foundation for something better, and leaving it in public hands for generations to come.
