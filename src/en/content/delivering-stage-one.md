# Delivering Stage One: {.app-content-centered}
## The Trinity College Dublin Prototype {.app-content-centered}

**The first stage of the Dot-Public rollout is the creation of a Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** developed in partnership with Trinity College Dublin (TCD). This partnership provides a credible, scholarly, and technically capable anchor for the prototype phase, grounding the project in an institution whose reputation is built on trust, rigour, and long-term stewardship of knowledge.

The purpose of the MVP is not to build a miniature version of the full Dot-Public system, but to create a functioning testbed for its core components. It will demonstrate that the proposed civic layer can coexist with the open internet and validate the operational, technical, and governance models required for long-term sustainability.

Using trusted academic and cultural material from Ireland's seven core universities (digitised monographs, doctoral theses, archival collections, peer-reviewed journals, curated exhibitions), it will provide a controlled, but representative, environment to test civic-grade standards, integrity, provenance, and public value.

The prototype will serve as a live laboratory to test and refine the three foundational pillars of Dot-Public, in order to demonstrate:

1. **The Civic Boundary**: Services defined by civic values can be built, maintained and accessed within a distinct provisioned namespace.

2. **The Civic Contract**: Meaningful governance rules can be developed, adopted and tested in practice, with real institutions and real users.

3. **The Civic Experience**: The concepts behind clean tools for Trust, Provenance, and universal Accessibility can be made tangible.

### Scope and Structure of the MVP
The MVP will be structured around four integrated testbeds, each designed to establish and also de-risk essential elements of the full-scale system.

1. **Domain Testbed**: To establish and manage the technical foundation of the civicboundary.
   - Creation of a provisional, trusted namespace (e.g., public.tcd.ie) to simulate the .PUBLIC gTLD.
   - Implementation of robust security protocols, including DNSSEC, to ensure integrity.
   - Establishment of a registry for participating services and enforcement of privacy-by-default principles.
   - Development and testing of technical mechanisms for displaying provenance indicators at the domain level.

2. **Governance Testbed**: To pilot the governance and compliance model outlined in the Civic Contract.
   - Establishment of a pilot Governance Body at TCD with representation from faculty, students, library/archives, and external civic advisers.
   - Drafting, ratification, and adoption of the first version of the Dot-Public Civic Contract, defining eligibility, obligations, and oversight procedures.
   - Live-testing of compliance audits and enforcement mechanisms with real institutional services and user groups.
   - Development of a transparent process for handling appeals and third-party challenges.

3. **Reference Models Testbed**: To build and demonstrate key reference services that embody Dot-Public values.
   - Civic Search Prototype: Development of a search tool that indexes only the pilot namespace, prioritises results based on provenance and authority, and surfaces transparency indicators.
   - Clean Tools Suite: Creation of an initial set of developer tools to audit sites for compliance, exposing inadvertent code violations, tracking elements, and accessibility issues.
   - Trusted Archive Service: TCD Library and Archives will provision a significant dataset (e.g., digitised special collections, theses, research data) within the [.public.tcd.ie] domain, serving as a live example of verifiable provenance and permanent, equitable access.

4. **Civic Experience Testbed**: To design and validate the user-facing signals of trust.
   - Development of a coherent design language and visual system for the .PUBLIC domain, including trust marks, provenance indicators, and accessibility badges.
   - Creation of a civic portal that explains the Dot-Public principles to users and gathers feedback.
   - Rigorous usability testing with students, faculty, and public participants to evaluate the clarity and effectiveness of trust signals.


### MVP Delivery Phases
The development of the prototype will be delivered in four discrete phases:

- Phase 1: Discovery (3 months)
  - Identify the technical architecture and governance framework.
  - Identify and inventory specific TCD/IUA systems and services for inclusion.
  - Convene the Governance Working Group
  - Define precise success metrics.

- Phase 2: Build (6 months)
  - Stand up the provisional namespace and registry.
  - Develop, adopt and deploy the reference services (Civic search, clean tools, trusted archive).
  - Draft and approve the first-level Civic Contract.
  - Design first-pass Trust and Provenance indicators.

- Phase 3: Test & Evaluate (3 months)
  - Conduct a controlled pilot with defined user groups (students, faculty, external testers).
  - Evaluate usability, governance functionality, technical resilience, and user trust.
  - Produce independent assessment reports on both technical and civic performance.
  - Refine the above based on findings

- Phase 4: Report & Scale (2 months)
  - Use findings to produce a public report: i.e. what worked, what failed, what is going to be required to achieve scale.
  - Formalise the proposal and business case for Stage Two national expansion within Ireland.

### Governance during prototype

- Steering Group co-chaired by Trinity and Dot-Public Ltd.
- Advisory support from external experts (DNS, governance, Accessibility, UX).
- Secretariat based at Trinity Library.

### Resourcing

- Project lead and coordinator (shared between Trinity and Dot-Public).
- Small engineering team (2–3) for DNS, signing, and services.
- Design/UX resource for civic experience.
- Governance/legal researcher to frame Civic Contract.
- Student research assistants for testing and user studies.

### Success criteria for prototype
- A functioning namespace with basic provenance enforcement.
- At least two working reference services in .PUBLIC.
- A published civic contract adopted by participants.
- A governance sandbox that has exercised decision-making and enforcement.
- Evidence from users that trust signals are visible and meaningful.

### Why Trinity College, Dublin?

Dot-Public is not only a technical experiment, it is an act of institutional leadership. The decision to begin this work at Trinity College Dublin is not incidental. It reflects the recognition that universities are both custodians of trusted knowledge and laboratories for the creation of new civic infrastructure. By anchoring the first prototype in an academic environment, Dot-Public is grounded in the very values it seeks to enforce online: provenance, rigour, accessibility, and trust.

The immediate focus of the prototype is practical. It will build a working model that allows verifiable academic and cultural data to be published within a bounded, rule-governed space. Academic datasets will provide the first test corpus, and the technical, legal, and governance mechanisms needed to sustain this layer will be explored in parallel. This is not yet a system for everyone, but a proof that such a system can exist, and that it can be done credibly, affordably, and sustainably.

Yet the implications extend far beyond the walls of Trinity. Around the world, governments, technologists, and civic institutions are converging on the idea of Digital Public Infrastructure: shared systems for identity, payments, records, and services. Ireland, through Trinity, has the opportunity to take a visible role in this global movement, positioning itself as a credible, neutral host of civic standards for the internet age.

For Trinity itself, the benefits are threefold. First, it affirms the University's scholarly mission by improving the discoverability and veracity of research material. Second, it strengthens Trinity's convening power, placing it at the centre of an international conversation about digital public goods. Third, it allows Trinity to lead by example, not only studying the problem of civic trust online, but actively building a solution that others can adopt, adapt, and benefit from.

The MVP is therefore more than a prototype. It is the first step in demonstrating how a university can act as an incubator for global civic infrastructure. By combining technical delivery with governance exploration and scholarly rigour, Trinity and Dot-Public together can set a precedent for how public institutions shape, rather than follow, the digital environment.
