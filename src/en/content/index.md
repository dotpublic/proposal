Dot-Public DRAFT 2.12 {.u-text-center .app-draft}

## Problem

The digital services that now underpin our public, cultural, and educational institutions were not designed with their needs in mind. Instead, they prioritise commercial incentives – scale, reach, data extraction, and proprietary lock-in – over public purpose. Consequently, organisations dedicated to safeguarding knowledge and serving society are forced to operate in environments optimised for profit, not people. This fundamental mismatch has eroded trust in the very institutions created to provide reliable information and expertise, while simultaneously fracturing society by amplifying division and fuelling online harms.

## Proposal

Dot-Public is an administered zone of the internet: a neutral, verifiable space governed by public rules where services can be created and maintained without compromise. It is not another platform, but a structured digital domain designed to support public goods. By establishing a clear civic boundary, enforceable civic contract, and trusted civic experience, it offers a foundation for institutions and citizens alike to connect, engage and contribute to public life online, with confidence and integrity.

## Pilot

To demonstrate feasibility, Dot-Public will begin with a minimum viable product in partnership with Trinity College Dublin. This prototype will show civic-grade standards working in practice, applied to real institutional data and services. The MVP is a proof point: that digital systems can be built where integrity and provenance are embedded, and where the public interest is prioritised by design.

## Scale

From this initial pilot, Dot-Public will expand to a national and an initial EU phase before pausing for assessment. The design is forkable and replicable, ensuring global potential without being captured by any single actor. The pilot establishes credibility; the next phases establish reach.

## Governance

Dot-Public will be held in trust, mission-locked against commercial or political capture. Governance will be multi-stakeholder, transparent, and enforceable. Its standards will align with wider global efforts in digital public infrastructure while remaining independent of both commercial platforms and governments.

## Funding

A phased funding model begins with the prototype, then moves to broader adoption. The structure balances credibility with deliverability, ensuring sustainability without diluting mission.

## Purpose

Dot-Public exists to create a civic internet where institutions can uphold their responsibilities, where citizens can trust what they encounter, and where public goods endure beyond shifting commercial or political priorities.
