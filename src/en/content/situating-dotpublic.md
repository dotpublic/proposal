# Situating Dot-Public:

## Existing digital public infrastructure

**Governments, technologists and civic leaders** across the world are fast beginning to recognise that the digital sphere requires its own civic infrastructure. Just as, in earlier centuries, nations invested in public roads, clean water, postal and communications networks, the twenty-first century now faces the task of providing trusted, open digital systems that connect and serve the public as a society.

The shared frame of reference for this thinking is often described as Digital Public Infrastructure, and at its core it describes open, standards based systems that enable societies to connect, interact, transact and trust one another in digital environments. These infrastructures do not aim to compete with markets but to provide the rails on which fair and reliable digital activity can take place.

This proposal aligns closely with UN principles and emerging European commitments to develop independent, open, inclusive, and rights-preserving digital public infrastructure. It is inspired by the European Parliament's call for human-centric digital systems that are interoperable, resilient, and accountable to the people they serve. Dot-Public offers precisely that: a shared civic network, grounded in law, maintained in the public interest, and available to all.

Its initial implementation is focused on the higher education sector in Ireland, a trusted national environment where the need for autonomy, provenance, and permanence is especially acute. By embedding Dot-Public within the Irish Universities Association (IUA) – a university-led alliance - we aim to demonstrate what a civic internet could look like in practice: public service without compromise, interoperability without proprietary dependence, and participation without surveillance.

Other examples already exist and they show what is possible. India Stack is perhaps the most widely known national model. It provides common tools for digital identity payments and services at scale, enabling citizens to interact with state and market alike through trusted digital credentials. The Beckn protocol extends this idea into the commercial sphere by enabling markets to interoperate on open terms which reduces dependence on centralised platforms and restores agency to both consumers and providers.

Across the globe, library and archival standards have achieved something similar for knowledge. By insisting on common formats, persistent identifiers and cataloguing conventions they have ensured that information can be preserved and discovered across borders and generations. Public service broadcasting represents another form of civic infrastructure. For nearly a century it has acted as the civic counterweight to commercial media embedding values of universality, impartiality and plurality into shared cultural life.

Taken together these initiatives illustrate the possibility and necessity of civic infrastructures that operate alongside markets but are not reducible to them. Dot Public should be understood as a member of a broad and extensive catalogue of similar initiatives. It shares the same DNA as Digital Public Infrastructure ideas across the globe, in its commitment to openness, enforceable standards and civic trust. But it is not a clone of any existing model and its focus is distinct.

Dot Public is different because of its structural design. It is not a protocol adopted at will or a platform layered onto the existing web. Instead it proposes a new administered zone anchored in its own top level domain, '.PUBLIC', and governed by a constitutional trust model. Participation is conditional. Only organisations that meet unambiguous standards and rules, on provenance, Accessibility, digital hygiene, openness, and accountability can operate within the Dot-Public space.

Sustainability is designed into the model with member contributions and carefully limited, transparent revenue sources. Resilience is ensured through 'forkability' which means the ability to duplicate, modify and continue the system if governance were ever compromised. This structural choice matters. It ensures that Dot Public is neither dependent on market incentives nor vulnerable to state or corporate capture. Its legitimacy comes from rules enforced at entry and maintained throughout participation not from the goodwill of incumbents.

Dot-Public should therefore be seen as a sibling to the many existing and emerging DPI efforts around the globe. It belongs within the same family of civic infrastructure approaches but it addresses a problem that none of the others have yet fully resolved, which is the crisis of trust in digital public life. Its contribution is to provide a bounded, rule-governed digital environment where institutions, organisations and individuals can offer services without compromise and people can know what they can believe.

The urgency of this is clear. Public trust in information systems is fracturing. Institutions struggle to prove their integrity in spaces optimised for manipulation rather than public service. Citizens move through digital environments without reliable signals of authenticity.

Dot Public is not a replacement for the internet but an additional layer. It is a civic infrastructure for dependability operating alongside the existing digital sphere. Just as clean water systems made cities liveable and public libraries secured access to shared knowledge, Dot Public is designed to restore the civic conditions of digital life.
