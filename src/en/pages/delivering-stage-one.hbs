    <h1>Delivering Stage One:</h1>
    <h2>The Trinity College Dublin Prototype</h2>

    <p><strong>The first stage of the Dot-Public rollout is the creation of a Minimum Viable Product
            (MVP)</strong> developed in partnership with Trinity College Dublin (TCD). This partnership provides
        a credible, scholarly, and technically capable anchor for the prototype phase, grounding the
        project in an institution whose reputation is built on trust, rigour, and long-term stewardship
        of knowledge.</p>

    <p>The purpose of the MVP is not to build a miniature version of the full Dot-Public system, but
        to create a functioning testbed for its core components. It will demonstrate that the proposed
        civic layer can coexist with the open internet and validate the operational, technical, and
        governance models required for long-term sustainability.</p>

    <p>Using trusted academic and cultural material from Ireland’s seven core universities (digitised
        monographs, doctoral theses, archival collections, peer-reviewed journals, curated
        exhibitions), it will provide a controlled, but representative, environment to test civic-grade
        standards, integrity, provenance, and public value.</p>

    <p>The prototype will serve as a live laboratory to test and refine the three foundational pillars of
        Dot-Public, in order to demonstrate:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>The Civic Boundary</strong>: Services defined by civic values can be built, maintained and
            accessed within a distinct provisioned namespace.</li>

        <li><strong>The Civic Contract</strong>: Meaningful governance rules can be developed, adopted and
            tested in practice, with real institutions and real users.</li>

        <li><strong>The Civic Experience</strong>: The concepts behind clean tools for Trust, Provenance, and
            universal Accessibility can be made tangible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Scope and Structure of the MVP</h3>
    <p>The MVP will be structured around four integrated testbeds, each designed to establish and
        also de-risk essential elements of the full-scale system.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Domain Testbed</strong>: To establish and manage the technical foundation of the civicboundary.
            <ul>
                <li>Creation of a provisional, trusted namespace (e.g., public.tcd.ie) to
                    simulate the .PUBLIC gTLD.</li>
                <li>Implementation of robust security protocols, including DNSSEC, to
                    ensure integrity.</li>
                <li>Establishment of a registry for participating services and enforcement
                    of privacy-by-default principles.</li>
                <li>Development and testing of technical mechanisms for displaying
                    provenance indicators at the domain level.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Governance Testbed</strong>: To pilot the governance and compliance model outlined in
            the Civic Contract.
            <ul>
                <li>Establishment of a pilot Governance Body at TCD with representation
                    from faculty, students, library/archives, and external civic advisers.</li>
                <li>Drafting, ratification, and adoption of the first version of the Dot-Public
                    Civic Contract, defining eligibility, obligations, and oversight
                    procedures.</li>
                <li>Live-testing of compliance audits and enforcement mechanisms with
                    real institutional services and user groups.</li>
                <li>Development of a transparent process for handling appeals and
                    third-party challenges.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Reference Models Testbed</strong>: To build and demonstrate key reference services that embody
            Dot-Public values.
            <ul>
                <li>Civic Search Prototype: Development of a search tool that indexes
                    only the pilot namespace, prioritises results based on provenance and
                    authority, and surfaces transparency indicators.</li>
                <li>Clean Tools Suite: Creation of an initial set of developer tools to audit
                    sites for compliance, exposing inadvertent code violations, tracking
                    elements, and accessibility issues.</li>
                <li>Trusted Archive Service: TCD Library and Archives will provision a
                    significant dataset (e.g., digitised special collections, theses, research
                    data) within the [.public.tcd.ie] domain, serving as a live example of
                    verifiable provenance and permanent, equitable access.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Civic Experience Testbed</strong>: To design and validate the user-facing signals of trust.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Development of a coherent design language and visual system for the
                    .PUBLIC domain, including trust marks, provenance indicators, and
                    accessibility badges.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Creation of a civic portal that explains the Dot-Public principles to
                    users and gathers feedback.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Rigorous usability testing with students, faculty, and public participants
                    to evaluate the clarity and effectiveness of trust signals.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Why Trinity College, Dublin?</h3>

    <p>Dot-Public is not only a technical experiment, it is an act of institutional leadership. The
        decision to begin this work at Trinity College Dublin is not incidental. It reflects the
        recognition that universities are both custodians of trusted knowledge and laboratories for
        the creation of new civic infrastructure. By anchoring the first prototype in an academic
        environment, Dot-Public is grounded in the very values it seeks to enforce online:
        provenance, rigour, accessibility, and trust.</p>

    <p>The immediate focus of the prototype is practical. It will build a working model that allows
        verifiable academic and cultural data to be published within a bounded, rule-governed
        space. Academic datasets will provide the first test corpus, and the technical, legal, and
        governance mechanisms needed to sustain this layer will be explored in parallel. This is not
        yet a system for everyone, but a proof that such a system can exist, and that it can be done
        credibly, affordably, and sustainably.</p>

    <p>Yet the implications extend far beyond the walls of Trinity. Around the world, governments,
        technologists, and civic institutions are converging on the idea of Digital Public Infrastructure:
        shared systems for identity, payments, records, and services. Ireland, through Trinity, has
        the opportunity to take a visible role in this global movement, positioning itself as a credible,
        neutral host of civic standards for the internet age.</p>

    <p>For Trinity itself, the benefits are threefold. First, it affirms the University’s scholarly mission
        by improving the discoverability and veracity of research material. Second, it strengthens
        Trinity’s convening power, placing it at the centre of an international conversation about
        digital public goods. Third, it allows Trinity to lead by example, not only studying the problem
        of civic trust online, but actively building a solution that others can adopt, adapt, and benefit
        from.</p>

    <p>The MVP is therefore more than a prototype. It is the first step in demonstrating how a
        university can act as an incubator for global civic infrastructure. By combining technical
        delivery with governance exploration and scholarly rigour, Trinity and Dot-Public together can
        set a precedent for how public institutions shape, rather than follow, the digital environment.</p>
