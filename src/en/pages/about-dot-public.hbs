    <h1>Who’s behind Dot-Public:</h1>
    <h2>A mission to develop a better internet</h2>

    <p><strong>Dot-Public Ltd. has been formed as an independent entity</strong>, to explore and develop ideas
        on how a civic layer of the internet could become reality, to build working models of the
        solutions it conceives, and to demonstrate its practical application and real-time use. Our
        ultimate goal is to create a digital public space where institutions, cultural organisations, and
        civic actors can be trusted to serve people openly, honestly, and without hidden agendas,
        and where individuals can, once again, participate freely, and safely, both openly and
        privately, without being deceived and divided through falsehood and outrage or entrapped
        and manipulated to be packaged and sold as behavioural data.</p>

    <h3>A civic internet for the public good</h3>
    <p>We propose a new, safer, trustworthy digital environment, a digital public space, that sits
        alongside the current internet and bridges between the uncompromising old services and
        reconsidered public-interest ones. It would combine public administration (mandating
        interoperability, supporting modification, enforcing safe harbours) with public goods (open
        protocols, reference code, free software, governance standards, rules of conduct, personal
        security) and public infrastructure (access to open networks, independent data repositories,
        trusted domains) to guarantee that essential digital services are run freely and on terms that
        protect citizens, not exploit them.</p>

    <p>Our goal is structural, not cosmetic. We aim to build something that endures: a parallel civic
        layer, governed in the public interest, free from capture, and strong enough to support the
        services, relationships, common goals, and shared objectives that functioning societies
        need. This is not about tinkering with today’s broken systems. It is about creating a
        foundation for something better, and leaving it in public hands for generations to come.</p>

    <h3>Dot-Public Ltd. exists to:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Consider how online trust, privacy, and democratic resilience can be rebuilt</li>
        <li>Develop principles and rules for a digital public space that is managed transparently
            and accountable to the public that it serves</li>
        <li>Test whether these ideas can work beyond theory and at scale</li>
        <li>Consider how online trust, privacy, and democratic resilience can be rebuilt</li>
        <li>Deliver practical demonstrations and technically proficient prototypes that turn
            strategy and policy into working solutions</li>
        <li>Consider how online trust, privacy, and democratic resilience can be rebuilt</li>
        <li>Build the evidence base to inform future decisions in support of global efforts towards
            creating a shared, trusted civic internet infrastructure</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Ultimately, our goal is to demonstrate that public digital infrastructure is as essential today as
        roads, water, or hospitals and other universally accessible public goods and services that
        previous generations built to support social cohesion and underpin civilised progress.</p>

    <h3>How we work and what we will build</h3>
    <p>We aim to <strong>create</strong> new technical, legal, and institutional solutions that demonstrate how
        public digital infrastructure can function in practice. We look to <strong>curate</strong> and share the
        knowledge, standards, and lessons from around the world, to inform better design choices
        and avoid repeating old mistakes. And we will <strong>convene</strong> the people, organisations,
        institutions, and networks needed to make our work genuinely inclusive, representative,
        participatory, and durable.</p>

    <h3>Dot-Public Ltd. will:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Develop design principles:</strong>
            Create clear civic rules and standards for digital public spaces, balancing
            openness, privacy, and accountability</li>
        <li><strong>Test feasibility:</strong>
            Examine the technical, legal, and economic realities of building a civic layer
            for the internet</li>

        <li><strong>Publish its research and ideas:</strong>
            Share discussions, analysis, concepts, and working models openly through
            articles, essays, and public briefings</li>

        <li><strong>Convene public conversations:</strong>
            Host discussions, workshops, and debates to test ideas, gather feedback,
            and invite wider participation</li>

        <li><strong>Prototype ideas:</strong>
            Run small experiments to demonstrate critical concepts such as provenance,
            civic identity, service delivery, inclusion, privacy guarantees, and trust signals</li>

        <li><strong>Develop larger pilot projects:</strong>
            Including the proposed Trinity College prototype, which would build and host
            real services, digital collections, and trust mechanisms within a pilot.public.ie
            domain</li>

        <li><strong>Develop trust signals:</strong>
            Design user experiences to include trust indicators, transparency tools, and
            provenance links so that people can recognise with confidence when they are
            in a public-first environment</li>

        <li><strong>Ensure device compatibility:</strong>
            Ensure any solutions work equally well on mobile devices and low-spec
            hardware, reflecting the real conditions in libraries, schools, and our
            communities of greatest need</li>

        <li><strong>Explore governance models:</strong>
            Identify sustainable ways to manage shared civic infrastructure across public
            institutions, diverse organisations, and national borders</li>

        <li><strong>Create open-access resources:</strong>
            Develop guides, toolkits, and reference materials to help institutions and
            communities understand, adopt, and shape the civic layer of the internet</li>

        <li><strong>Build networks:</strong>
            Grow a community of thinkers, technologists, institutions, and funders
            committed to the creation and maintenance of public digital infrastructure</li>

        <li><strong>Assess the feasibility of must-carry obligations:</strong>
            To guarantee universal access to public and civic services without technology
            barriers or commercial interference</li>

        <li><strong>Contribute to the debates around digital sovereignty:</strong>
            Explore how Dot-Public might support strategic digital autonomy and reduce
            dependency on non-national or commercial technology providers</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Think – Test – Build – Share</h3>
    <p>Dot-Public is ambitious. It proposes structural changes to how a dedicated part of the
        internet can work and how institutions can choose to engage with citizens online. However, it
        would be risky and costly to launch large-scale technical solutions before proving that the
        ideas will work, the rules can be enforced, that institutions will participate, and that users will
        come to trust and adopt them.</p>

    <h3>This approach will allow us to:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Debate the issues</li>

        <li>Clarify priorities</li>

        <li>Gather the right mix of skills and partners</li>
        <li>Develop working models for funders and policymakers</li>
        <li>Test governance and policy ideas before building large-scale systems</li>
        <li>Construct working prototypes, ensuring that policy thinking about technology and
            user experience is grounded in practical reality</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        And ensure that when Dot-Public is built and running, it is designed for enduring civic value
        and resilience, rather than to demonstrate short-term technological accomplishment.
    </p>

    <h3>Who we invite to join us</h3>
    <p>We welcome participation from:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Academics and researchers</li>
        <li>Libraries, archives, and cultural institutions</li>
        <li>Public-interest technologists focused on privacy, encryption, identity, or digital
            provenance</li>
        <li>Policy experts in internet governance, law, and regulation</li>
        <li>Civil society organisations</li>
        <li>Government agencies interested in civic digital infrastructure</li>
        <li>Funders who believe the internet should also serve the public good</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Alongside these, we welcome support and contributions from anyone committed to the
        principle that digital public service infrastructure must be just as reliable, stable, trustworthy,
        and equitable as the physical infrastructure our societies have built in previous generations.</p>

    <h3>Outcomes</h3>The outcomes we aim to deliver / The work will generate:
    <p>The outcomes we aim to deliver / The work will generate:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Policy and technical white papers</li>
        <li>Pilot projects on existing domains such as .org or .ie to test civic standards</li>
        <li>Governance recommendations for a future .PUBLIC domain</li>
        <li>Standards for transparency, privacy, and provenance</li>
        <li>Engagement with governments, regulators, and public institutions</li>
        <li>A working pilot developed with Trinity College, demonstrating real services, trust signals, and governance
            in action</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Plus other policy frameworks and agreements to determine how a civic internet layer could
        operate alongside existing commercial systems without undermining their viability, but
        instead providing an alternative so that the public in all participating nations can recognise,
        appreciate, and choose to use it whenever they wish or need to.</p>

    <p>Dot-Public’s long-term vision remains the creation of a dedicated civic layer for the internet.
        But our first step is to think rigorously, build confidently, and work collaboratively to make it
        real, credible, and sustainable.</p>

    <p>Dot-Public is not another digital portal or platform. It is an attempt to change the ground
        beneath them – to lay down the shared and dependable civic infrastructure that the internet
        never got, where public institutions and communities can operate on rules of trust, dignity,
        and accountability.</p>

    <p>Our goal is structural, not cosmetic. We aim to build something that endures: a parallel civic
        layer, governed in the public interest, free from capture, and strong enough to support the
        services, relationships, and shared truths that a functioning society needs. This is not about
        tinkering with today’s broken systems. It is about creating a foundation for something better,
        and leaving it in public hands for generations to come.</p>
